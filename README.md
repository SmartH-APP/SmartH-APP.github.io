there is just one problem :
 The page at 'https://smarth-app.github.io/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=42.8746212&lon=74.5697617&appid=82005d27a116c2880c8f0fcb866998a0'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS. 
 BUT IT IS WORKS!!!
